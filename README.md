YEEEES BABYYYY I'M TAKING EVERYTHING BACK
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT ? *(nobody)*

with a lot of pain I'm going to update everything in v14 and try to go further with the Classes because I want to implement some kind of AI but shhh... I'm not saying more.
*(I already have a lot of work to do)*

**UPDATE**: After a massive disinterest from my friends, I couldn't continue this big project without feedbacks.

It's sad but it is what it is. I'll continue to make new branchs and update when Discord.js release a major update but that's all.

You'll live forever in my heart Mozu â™¥.
